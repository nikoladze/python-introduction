# Introduction to Python

[Run in your browser with JupyterLite](https://nikoladze.github.io/python-introduction/lab/index.html?path=presentation.ipynb)

This is a 120 minute lecture that introduces Python. There are
no assumptions made at all about prior knowledge of Python, though
any experience of programming and unix basics are handy. The
material covers basic syntactic building blocks first, then
shows off some Python data science capabilities, then finally
returns to some slightly more advanced topics to round out
students' knowledge. There should be enough content that people
who do know basic Python will learn from it.

The lecture is written as a Jupyter notebook and the popular
[RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) or [jupyterlab-deck](https://jupyterlab-deck.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
extensions can be used to present the material as a slideshow.
